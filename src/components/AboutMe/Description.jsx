        I graduated from the University of South Florida Honors College with a
        Bachelor of Science in Environmental Biology and a minor in Geographic
        Information System technology. As I ventured into the world of
        technology when studying GIS in my undergraduate career, I found a
        strong passion in programming that I wanted to further pursue. I
        recently completed a software engineering intensive boot camp abroad at
        General Assembly Australia; this program had a broad focus on full stack
        development. Working in Typescript is my expertise, especially in
        React.js and Node.js frameworks.

        After working as a junior software engineer at a small company, I was
        unfortunately laid off with the two other junior developers due to the
        company facing financial issues. I am now in a new position at Dispel as
        an associate full-stack engineer, specializing in remediating code-based
        vulnerabilities.

        In my free time, I enjoy backpacking, surfing, yoga, weight-lifting, and
        writing. My first poetry piece, "Lost Paradise", was published in a
        literary magazine called Flora Fiction in June 2023. As a big animal
        lover, I volunteer twice a week at a local cat rescue called CJPaws.
