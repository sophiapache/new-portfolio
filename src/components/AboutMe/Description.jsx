      I graduated from the University of South Florida Honors College with a
      Bachelor of Science in Environmental Biology and a minor in Geographic
      Information System technology. As I ventured into the world of technology
      when studying GIS in my undergraduate career, I found a strong passion in
      programming that I wanted to further pursue. I recently completed a
      software engineering intensive boot camp abroad at General Assembly
      Australia; this program had a broad focus on full stack development.
      Working in front-end development is my expertise, especially in React.js
      and Vue.js frameworks. After working six months as a junior software
      engineer at a small company, I was unfortunately laid off with the two
      other junior developers due to the company facing financial issues,
      therefore I am ready to excel in a new role. I am an individual that is
      eager to learn new technologies, embrace change, and willing to take new
      directions. In my free time, I enjoy backpacking, surfing, yoga,
      weight-lifting, and writing. My first poetry piece, "Lost Paradise", was
      published in a literary magazine called Flora Fiction in June 2023! I also
      recently started learning the bass guitar. As a big animal lover, I
      volunteer twice a week at a local cat rescue called CJPaws.
